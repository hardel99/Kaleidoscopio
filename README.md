# Kaleidoscopio

This is the first android app that i made some years ago, sadly this isn't a kaleidoscope or at least, what i think that an app called kaleidoscopio should do.

Anyway, this app let you draw on the screen and reflect the points you're doing making a mandala like drawing. Also let you cutomize the colors and the number of points(from 2 to 30) that are reflecting the original.
